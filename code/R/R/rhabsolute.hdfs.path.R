#' Get Absolute HDFS Path
#'
#' Changes a relative path (a path without a leading /) into an absolute path
#' based on the value of hdfs.getwd().  If it is already an absolute path there 
#' is no change to the returned path.
#'
#' 
#'
#' For all returns, any trailing "/" are removed from the path (if path nchar > 1).
#' 
#' @param paths Path to examine and change to absolute.  Input characters or a list or vector of characters.
#' @return Absolute HDFS path corresponding to relative path in the input.  If input is a vector or list returns a vector or list of paths.  Class of elements of return are always character even if NA.

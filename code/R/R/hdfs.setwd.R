#' Set HDFS Working Directory
#'
#' Sets a working directory for all Rhipe commands that use the HDFS.
#' By default hdfs.working.dir is set to "/".  All input directories to
#' all Rhipe commands may omit a leading "/" and indicate they are off of
#' the current hdfs.working.dir. 
#' 
#' This is anagolous to how file operations
#' in R work off the current working directory.
#
#'  
#' Using working directories with relative paths for input and output
#' helps users make more portable scripts.
#' 
#' @param path Path to set working directory.  May be relative the current 
#' HDFS working directory or absolute.
#' @param check.valid.hdfs Optional.  By default hdfs.setwd checks to see if
#' if the HDFS directory exist by trying to list files in it.  If it doesn't appear to
#' exist it doesn't set the working directory.  If this check seems cumbersome to you,
#' you may disable it by setting this to FALSE.

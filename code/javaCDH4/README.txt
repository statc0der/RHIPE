Currently, the only source file that needs to be changed to work with CDH4 is RHMR.java.  In this directory is that one file and the pom for building.

To build:

# working directory is javaCDH4

# first, temporarily copy all .java files except RHMR.java over to the src/main/java/org/godhuli/rhipe directory

mvn compile
mvn package

cp target/rhipe-cdh4-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ../R/inst/java/RhipeCDH4.jar

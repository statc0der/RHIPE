* RHIPE: R and Hadoop Integrated Processing Environment

Analyze Data using Hadoop tools from within the R environment (e.g. MapReduce)

Documentation: http://saptarshiguha.github.com/RHIPE/


** Changes

Many! And better documentation to come soon. Very importantly, =rhmr= has gone and is now replaced by =rhwatch=.
Though the warning says 'use the same arguments', this is not true. Here is a quick conversion

The parameters =ifolder=, =ofolder= and =inout= have gone. 

- For sequence input and sequence output, =rhwatch(, input=path-to-input, output=path-to-output)=
- For text input and sequence output, =rhwatch(, input=rhfmt(path-to-input,type='text'), output=path-to-output=
- For text output, sequence input, =rhwatch(, input=path-to-input, output=rhfmt(path-to-output, type='text')=
- For the mapreduce equivalent of =lapply(1:N, F)=, do =rhwatch(map=rhmap({ rhcollect(k, F(k) )}), input=N)=
  for documentation regarding these , ask the google groups mailing list.

And there is support for reading from HBase, writing to HBase too(experimental).
